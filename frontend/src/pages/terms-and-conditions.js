                                tools to publish and distribute books, BlueCloud itself is a

                                modify the Work. Certain modifications may occur caused by file or
                                design conversions. BlueCloud does not guarantee the accurate

                                decide not to Publish Author’s work or may decide to discontinue its

                                Service, BlueCloud will make every attempt to provide reasonable
                                notice to the Author via email, up to and including providing
                                instructions on how to remedy potential issues that might prevent
                                BlueCloud from listing a title.

                                <strong>2c. How to "Unpublish" Works from BlueCloud:</strong> BlueCloud
                                may Publish the Work until the Author of the Work decides to unpublish
                                the work (to unpublish, log in to the system, click on “Dashboard” and
                                then click “unpublish”). If the author is unable to access the site,
                                the author may notify BlueCloud in writing to remove the Work. After
                                that notice, BlueCloud will remove the work from BlueCloud.com and all
                                other partnered sites within seven business days.If the author's or publisher's book has been distributed via the Global Distribution, the removal from the retail partners' digital shelves may take several weeks. BlueCloud will do its best to assist authors and publishers to have their works removed, and to ensure authors/publishers who terminate their BlueCloud accounts receive full payment for sales that may occur after account termination. To ensure your book is properly and quickly removed from the channel, go to your Dashboard and unpublish it. This will cause BlueCloud channel partners to receive automatic notification to remove the book. Do not contact BlueCloud first and ask to have your account deleted, as this will not remove your book from the channel. After you have unpublished your book, and after you have confirmed all channel partners have removed the book, then you may contact BlueCloud if you want your account deleted (and please inform BlueCloud you have confirmed the book is no longer in the channel).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>2d. Removal of poorly designed works :</strong> At the top of the each page where authors publish their works, BlueCloud clearly communicates to all authors and publishers their responsibility to study and follow the design tutorials. formatting requirements prior to uploading a manuscript to BlueCloud.

                                BlueCloud , at its option, may without warning close the accounts of authors and publishers who blatantly ignore the formatting requirements. We urge all BlueCloud authors not to waste the time of readers, our retail partners or BlueCloud with poorly designed works.

BlueCloud takes claims of infringement seriously and may take immediate action upon notice from someone claiming to be an Infringed party. Generally, upon receipt of a written notice from a party infringed or defamed by Author’s material (or someone purporting to be his agent, publisher, attorney in fact or assign), BlueCloud will remove the Author’s Work and reserves the right to remove any and all information about the Author, the Author’s Work or the publisher from the Site. The burden of proof, in such cases will be on the author and they will have to provide demanded documents for us to republish/reinstate the work.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>3b. Infringement by Others Upon Author’s Work:</strong> If an Author or copyright holder learns that a third party is violating Author’s copyright or pirating or illegally distributing a BlueCloud -published work, the Author shall inform BlueCloud ; however, it is the Author’s responsibility to seek relief from the offending parties. If that work is published on BlueCloud , BlueCloud will remove it per section 3a above.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>3c. Rights Clearances and Other Legal Matters:</strong>Rights Clearances and Other Legal Matters.

                            <h3>4. Copyright.</h3>
                            <p> The copyright in the Work shall belong to the Author or the party that Author cites as the copyright holder. The author shall be solely responsible for filing its copyrights and any other intellectual property with the appropriate governmental body or can buy such services from BlueRose.</p>

                            <p>So long as the proper copyright protection subsists in the Work, no infringement notices have been filed, and revenues directly attributable to the Work are being collected by BlueCloud , the Author and/or publishing party shall be entitled to the agreed payments: The publisher offers 70% of the profit as per the website calculator, from all sales. Actual royalty amount is calculated based on the work’s final specifications.</p>

                            <p><strong>6a. Electronic Editions:</strong>BlueCloud agrees to pay the Author or Publisher (whoever uploaded the content) up to seventeen percent (17%) of net proceeds received by BlueCloud through the sale or licensing of your work (“List Price”). “Net proceeds” shall mean sales price paid and received less payment processing fees, affiliate fees, retailer discounts, costs due to erroneous or fraudulent transactions, credit card charge-backs and associated fees. Therefore, 17% of “net proceeds” does not equal 17% of the book’s sales price. BlueCloud fully discloses and estimates anticipated payment processing fees and estimated proceeds to the Author at the time of submission of work.</p>

                            <p><strong>6b.

                                sampling rights, and output formats.

                            <p>
                                Although BlueCloud will refer in this agreement to “Royalties”
                                for the sake of simplicity, payments to authors and publishers
                                are usually considered “other income.” BlueCloud pays author (or
                                Author's Agent) and publisher as and when demanded, and never
                                later than 15 working days. Payments to authors are based on the
                                accrued balance earned as of the last day of each calendar month,
                                and this accrued balance is based on actual payment to BlueCloud
                                by the customer or retailer (please remember that retailers will
                                usually report sales to BlueCloud before those sales become
                                payable to BlueCloud, and therefore before they can accrue to
                                the author's payable balance). It is the author's responsibility
                                to ensure their payment settings are complete and accurate,
                                otherwise, payments may be delayed until the issue is resolved
                                and verified.
                            </p>

                                <strong>8a. Tax Withholding:</strong> Authorities require BlueCloud
                                to collect tax certifications from all authors and publishers and
                                withhold all required taxes. All authors and publishers must
                                complete the required formalities as per government regulations
                                to withdraw the withheld taxes.

                                <strong>8b. Account Security:</strong> As an author, publisher or
                                agent, you are responsible for controlling access to your BlueCloud
                                account. When you sign up for a BlueCloud account, you will provide
                                BlueCloud an email address, phone number, and a password as your
                                login credentials. By publishing with BlueCloud, you acknowledge
                                your responsibility to choose a secure email/password combination,
                                and it is your responsibility to keep this email/password combination
                                private and secure and to update your password as needed to maintain
                                account security.
