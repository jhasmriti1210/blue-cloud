                                then click “unpublish”). If the author is unable to access the site,
                                the author may notify BlueCloud in writing to remove the Work. After
                                that notice, BlueCloud will remove the work from BlueCloud.com and all
                                other partnered sites within seven business days.If the author's or publisher's book has been distributed via the Global Distribution, the removal from the retail partners' digital shelves may take several weeks. BlueCloud will do its best to assist authors and publishers to have their works removed, and to ensure authors/publishers who terminate their BlueCloud accounts receive full payment for sales that may occur after account termination. To ensure your book is properly and quickly removed from the channel, go to your Dashboard and unpublish it. This will cause BlueCloud channel partners to receive automatic notification to remove the book. Do not contact BlueCloud first and ask to have your account deleted, as this will not remove your book from the channel. After you have unpublished your book, and after you have confirmed all channel partners have removed the book, then you may contact BlueCloud if you want your account deleted (and please inform BlueCloud you have confirmed the book is no longer in the channel).
