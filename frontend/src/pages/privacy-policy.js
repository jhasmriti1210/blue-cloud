                            <p>
                                BlueCloud utilizes a number of computer security best practices and procedures to protect access to the personally identifiable data collected and stored at BlueCloud. However, the most important access control starts with you. When you register for an account, BlueCloud will prompt you to provide a unique and robust password.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Your email address and password will serve as your login credentials. To prevent unauthorized access to your account, it’s important you select an email/password combination that you have never used at any other website.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Registering for an Account</h2>
                            <p>
                                Personal information required for Registration - To create an account at BlueCloud, you will click the “Register” link to register for a free BlueRose account. We require a working email address; an agreement to abide by our BlueCloud Terms of Service, an acknowledgment of our Privacy Policy, and a certification that your age is either under 18 years or 18 and over.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For book consumers, the benefits of registration include the ability to:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Purchase, access and download multi-format books.</li>
                                <li>Access purchased books forever, even if the author or publisher later “takes their book out of print” and stops selling it.</li>
                                <li>Access free updates to the book in the event the author/publisher updates the book at BlueCloud.</li>
                                <li>Rate and review books you’ve read.</li>
                                <li>Access exclusive sales promotions not available to non-registered users.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                For book producers, in addition to all the benefits received by consumers above, registration also gives you the ability to:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Publish books</li>
                                <li>Distribute books</li>
                                <li>Centrally manage your book’s metadata, pricing, updates and distribution</li>
                                <li>Access aggregated sales reporting, including our attractive Daily Sales report which provides same-day and next-day sales analytics</li>
                                <li>Receive payments for the books you’ve sold through the BlueCloud distribution network of major retailers and library partners</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h2>Information Collected on This Site</h2>
                            <p>
                                For all visitors to the BlueCloud website, we automatically collect aggregated and anonymized data such as browser type, page views, clickstream, and usage. We use Google Analytics for this data tracking service. Because this information is aggregated and anonymized, it’s not visible to the general public. It’s only visible to key BlueCloud employees and is used to help us optimize the performance and usability of the site.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition to the anonymized analytics collected above, we may also work with similar services to monitor purchase transactions and detect fraud.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We also track IP addresses, account logins, profile views; and books viewed, sampled and purchased.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                For book merchandising and promotion purposes, we leverage anonymous aggregated sales data to make automated book recommendations and display content that matches reader interests. We may also use your browsing or purchase history to improve your book discovery experience by recommending books similar to those you’ve purchased or enjoyed in the past.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Data You Provide and Produce after Registration
                                This section summarizes the data that you directly provide to BlueCloud after registration, along with data you will generate through the course of your voluntary use of our service</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Book consumers</strong> -  If you choose to purchase a book (account registration and login required), we will require a valid credit/debit card or other banking details; your postal mailing address to which the card or payment method is attached; and your country location. This information enables us to receive payment, prevent fraud, issue refunds and satisfy our legal obligations..
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <strong>Book producers</strong> -  If you use BlueCloud to publish, promote and distribute books, as mentioned above, a free account registration is required. To receive payment for book sales, and to comply with laws, we will require you to provide us a valid Tax Identification Number, a postal or digital payment address so we can pay you, and a physical mailing address that we may use for both for payments and for tax compliance purposes. We will track your sales history so we can report it to you, pay you, and so that we may further market and promote your books.

                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Additional Data Collection</strong> - We record several details related to your usage of the site such as reviews you’ve posted, books you’ve published, books you’ve sold, author pages you’ve browsed, books you’ve sampled or purchased, royalties or commissions you’ve earned, and books and authors you have favorited or followed.

                            </p>
                            <p>We do not disclose your personally identifiable information or usage to third parties except when processing purchases, payments, or for fraud and abuse detection. However, any information you voluntarily upload or post to the site, such as books, book reviews or personal profile information, becomes publicly available to other users of the site.</p>
                            <p>We do not expose your registration email on the website.</p>
                            <p>BlueCloud allows registered authors to publish their works under pseudonyms also known as “pen names.” The author’s true identity is not shared with customers unless the author shares it themselves through other means.</p>
                            <p>Authors and publishers who wish to receive payments for their works on BlueCloud are required to provide additional registration information, such as their real name, a postal mailing address, and tax ID information to comply with laws. BlueCloud will only use this contact information to fulfill our obligations to you and to any tax or legal authorities who should require it, and we will never sell or rent out this information to third parties.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Disclosure of Personal Information</strong> - BlueCloud is not in the business of selling personal information to third parties. Instead, we’re in the business of helping readers find and purchase the books they’ll enjoy reading, and helping authors and publishers serve readers with their books.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We don't sell your personal data to third parties. This also means we never sell or rent out the email contact information for BlueCloud users. If we provide you the option to share your email address with a particular author or publisher, such option will be clearly presented, opt-in only, and your choice. </p>

                            <p>However, if there's a business reason to share your email expeditiously with a trusted business partner, and we're confident that by doing so we're providing you greater service, then we will do so. One common example of this is when a merchandising manager at a large retailer requests an introduction to one of our hot authors so they can discuss a merchandising feature. Yay!</p>

                            <p>BlueCloud , like many businesses, will collaborate with other companies to perform certain business-related functions. Examples of such functions include data services that host our website or data files; certified public accountants which help us manage tax reporting and compliance, or the customer service software company that hosts our customer service platform. When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function.</p>

                            <p>
                                <strong>It's Your Data</strong> - BlueCloud gives you control over your data. For example, did you find an error on your author profile page? Click to Account, then click to Edit Account Profile and fix it instantly.
                            </p>
                            <p>Do you regret that negative book review you left the other day? Click to your profile page, scroll down the summary of your reviews, and click Delete.</p>

                            <p>Is that author you favorited four years ago no longer a favorite, and you don't want them listed on your profile page as a favorite? Unfavorite them.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Legal Disclosures</strong> - BlueCloud may disclose personal data if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such an action is necessary to (i) comply with a legal obligation, (ii) protect and defend the rights or property of BlueCloud and our users, (iii) act in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of our service or others (such as if we receive a threat to harm oneself or others), (iv) protect against legal liability, (v) or we’re compelled to do so to protect our users and partners against fraud.
                            </p>
                            <p>We may share limited data with our retailers and media partners, such as recent sales rankings or preorder accumulation totals. To promote our authors and publishers, we will share bestseller lists of our top performing titles and authors with media outlets (such as our bestseller lists published by Publishers Weekly magazine) and retailers (such as the merchandising work we do to recommend our most promising titles to the merchandising managers at retailers and library platforms). We believe this is a valuable service to all our users - authors, publishers and readers alike. In no instance will we publicly divulge a book’s or author’s or publisher’s specific sales data without your written permission.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>BlueCloud Email Policy</strong> - We don’t sell or rent out the email addresses of our users to third parties.
                            </p>
                            <p>At BlueCloud , this communication takes place almost exclusively over email or phone call.</p>

                            <p>When you sign up for a BlueCloud account, you are giving us permission to contact you so that we may fulfill our service duties to you.</p>

                            <p>Most of these communications are automated or semi-automated based on event triggers (such as you purchase an ebook, we send you a purchase receipt and access information). In all cases, such communications will be germane to the reason you joined BlueCloud (to read books or produce books) in the first place.</p>

                            <p>If you publish books at BlueCloud , examples of event triggers for automated email notifications include when you publish a book; when BlueCloud approves your book for selected distribution; when you sell a book at the BlueCloud store; and when your book is reviewed by a customer in the BlueCloud store. You will also receive our exclusive “BlueCloud Author/Publisher Alerts” to notify you of important service developments, best practices recommendations, and policy changes.</p>

                            <p>If you purchase books at BlueRose, you’ll receive an automated purchase confirmation containing links to your purchased books. Later, we may send you an automated email reminder to review it.</p>

                            <p>You control your communication settings. All subscription-based emails contain one-click opt-outs, and users can also manage their communications settings by clicking to Account: Communications Settings.</p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Advertising on the BlueCloud Site</strong> - BlueCloud does not run third party advertisements on the BlueCloud site and therefore does not work with ad services or ad tracking firms that might seek to track your habits as you browse the web.

                            </p>

                            <p>
                                <strong>Children's Guidelines</strong> - BlueCloud is an ebook retailer and distributor. We market our service to adults. We do not market BlueCloud to children.</p>
                            <p>Like any ordinary bookstore, BlueCloud hosts children's books but also adult books that may contain themes and situations not appropriate for children. We take multiple steps in partnership with our authors and publishers to prevent inappropriate content from being exposed to children.</p>

                            <p>When authors and publishers publish at BlueCloud , they state whether their book is appropriate for those under the age of 18 years. Per the BlueCloud Terms of Service - which all publishers are required to reassert their agreement to prior to publishing a new book at BlueCloud – we require that they provide accurate categorization information. Violators face possible account closure and lose the ability to sell books through our service.</p>

                            <p>During site registration when a user signs up for our service, we ask the user to inform us if they’re under or over 18 years of age. If they tell us they’re under the age of 18, we will block them from viewing adult content.</p>

                            <p>If BlueCloud learns that a child has posted personally identifiable or private information that would allow others to contact or identify the child, BlueCloud will remove the information.</p>

                            <p>

                                <strong>Links to Other Websites</strong> - At BlueCloud , we link to a lot of websites. For example, every registered BlueCloud user has the ability to publish their social media hyperlinks on their BlueCloud profile page, including links to their personal website, blog, Facebook or Twitter. The BlueCloud Privacy Policy applies only to BlueCloud , not to these third-party destinations.
                            </p>

                            <p>

                                <strong>Security</strong> - BlueCloud applies multiple best practices and techniques to protect the personal data of our users from misuse, or unauthorized access, disclosure, or destruction. However, no Internet business or email transmission can ever be fully secure or error-free, and therefore we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Security tip </strong>: Email communications are inherently insecure. We ask that BlueCloud publishers never transmit sensitive personal information over email, such as tax identification numbers. Instead, we provide secure encrypted means to collect this important information over secure web forms on our site that use industry-standard encryption. In the case of the tax identification numbers, you can enter them under Account Settings.
                            </p>
                            <p>

                                <strong>Account Closure</strong> - You have the option to close your account at any time. By closing your account, all publicly visible information about the user on BlueCloud will disappear.
                            </p>
                            <p>Users who wish to close their BlueCloud account can do so by clicking on delete account on the dashboard.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Please think carefully before requesting account closure. If you have a specific concern that might prompt you to want to close your account, please share it with our support team. Often, our team can suggest even better options that will meet your privacy needs but still allow you to continue benefiting from the BlueCloud service.
